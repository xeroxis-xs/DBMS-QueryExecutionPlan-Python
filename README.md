# DBMS-QueryExecutionPlan-Python
The broad aims of the project are as follows: • Retrieve and visualize the QEP of a given SQL query. • Support what-if queries on the QEP by enabling interactive modification of the  physical operators and join order in the visual tree view of the QEP to generate  an AQP.  • Retrieve the estimated cost of the AQP and compare its cost with the QEP.
